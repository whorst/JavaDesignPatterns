Avoids Costly Creation
Avoids Subclassing
Dont Use the Keyword New - The first instance might use the word new but after they are closed
An Interface could be used
We could also use a registry to keep track of objects

Design
- Clone/Cloneable
- Avoids Keyword new
- Each instance unique
- Can utilize parameters for construction

Pitfalls
- Not really used
- Used With Other Patterns. A framework is a pattern which uses other patterns
    - registry
- Shallow copy is only done with clone, not deep copy.
