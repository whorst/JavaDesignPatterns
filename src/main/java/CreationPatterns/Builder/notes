Builder
    Handles Complex Constructors
    Large number of parameters
    Immutability can be forced once construction is finished
    Examples - StringBuilder, DocumentBuilder

Design
    Written with a static inner class which returns the instance of the object it is building
    Static Inner Class
    Negates the need for exposed setters
