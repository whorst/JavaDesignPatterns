Concepts
    -When a subject has one to many observers
    -Objects get decoupled
    -Event Handling
    -Could be called Pub/Sub model
    -Sometimes used in async fashion

Examples
    -Java.util.observer
    -Java.util.EventListener
    -

Design
    -Subject that needs to be observed
    -Observer
    -The subject implements an observable interface
    -Concrete observers are views in event driven application

Pitfalls
    -Large update consequences

Compared to mediator....
    -The observer has one subject and many observers
    -Decouple
    -Uses a pub sub model

The mediator
    -Is more of a one to one to many
    -Used to handle complex communication
