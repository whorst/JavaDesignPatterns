-Allows you to encapsulate each request as an object

Concepts
-Object oriented callback requests
-Decoupled sender from processor
-Often used for undo functionality
-examples: java.lang.Runnable, javax.swing.Actions

Design
-Object per command
-Command interface, all implementations of this interface contains an execute method
-unexecute method
-Reflections decouples the client from the receiver
-Made up of command, invoker, and ConcreteCommand

Pitfalls
-Dependence on other patterns
-Multiple Commands
-Make use of Memnto pattern to handle state?
