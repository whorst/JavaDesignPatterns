Concepts
-Return Object to previous state
-Externalize internal state
-Undo/rollback
-Shields complex internals from other objects

example: Java.io.serializable - Have an objects state recreatable

Design
-Class based
-Originator creates a memento
-Caretaker - manages the copies of the objects we've created, the list of undos
-Memento - represents the copy of the originator we want to store
-Magic cookie -The combination of fields it takes to save the object
