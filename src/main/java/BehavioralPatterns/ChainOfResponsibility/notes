Concepts
-Used to decouple sender and receiver objects.
    -They dont necessarily have to know who they are
-Receiver contains reference to next receiver
-Used to Promote loose coupling
-No Handler - OK
-Example of this is java.util.logging.Logger#log()
-Another example is the Spring Security Filter Chain

Design
-Chain of receiver objects
-Handler is interface based
-ConcreteHandler for each implementation
-Each Handler has a reference to the next
-Handler, Concrete Handler

Pitfalls
-Handling/Handler Guaranteed
    -Not Guaranteed will someone in the chain will handle the request
-Chain length can get quite hard with more handlers

-Handlers should be unique and knowing about its successor
