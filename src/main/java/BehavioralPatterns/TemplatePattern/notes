Concepts
-Great for code reuse
-IoC Use this to allow pluggable components
-Algorithm Emphasis
-Collections.sort

Design
-Based around abstract base class
-Hooks
-Operations
-AbstractBase, Concrete Class

Pitfalls
-Restrict access to certain methods
-Confusing Hierarchy
-Difficult program flow

Compared to strategy pattern

Template uses same algorithm, is class based, and is chosen at compile time
-Strategy pattern is an algorithm per strategy, and more about the interface. Chosen at runtime
