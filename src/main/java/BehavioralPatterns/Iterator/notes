Concepts
-used to traverse a container
-Don't expose underlying structure of whats being iterated
-Decouple algorithms
-Sequential in nature, even if not all objects have a sequential set of data

example: java.util.Iterator, java.util.Enumeration

Design:
-Interface based, the object being iterated will provide a method to return an iterator from it
-Independent but fail fast, two iterators cant modify object without errors
-Enumerators are fail safe
-Iterator, ConcreteIterator
